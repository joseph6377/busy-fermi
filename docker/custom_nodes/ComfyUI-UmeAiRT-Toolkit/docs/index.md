# UmeAiRT Toolkit

A modern, block-based node pack for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) — designed for clean workflows, auto-downloading model bundles, and pipeline-driven generation.

## Highlights

- **36 Nodes** organized into logical blocks (Loaders, Settings, Sampler, Post-Process, Utilities)
- **Block Architecture** — connect model bundles, settings, and prompts into a single pipeline
- **Auto-Download** — select a model family + version, and the Bundle Loader downloads missing files automatically
- **Multi-Architecture** — supports SD 1.5, SDXL, FLUX, Z-IMAGE (Lumina2), and fragmented (Diffusers) models
- **GGUF Support** — load quantized models directly (Q4, Q8, FP8) for low-VRAM setups
- **Built-in Post-Processing** — UltimateSD Upscale, SeedVR2 Upscale, FaceDetailer, Detailer Daemon
